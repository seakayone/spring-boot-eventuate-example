# Spring Boot Eventuate Example

Simple example of how to use https://github.com/RBMHTechnology/eventuate/[eventuate] with http://spring.io/[Spring Boot].

This project consists of a couple of sub projects:

1. *events-model* This project contains the shared events model for every event source service.

2. *spring-boot-complaint-store* This is a Spring Boot service running on port 8080. It emits ComplaintCreated events and makes the them accessible using a simple REST API:

   POST :8080 {"id":"1", "company":"Acme", "description":"Your stuff breaks"} // creates a new complaint

   GET  :8080    // returns all complaints

   GET  :8080/id // returns a single complaints with the corresponding id

3. *spring-boot-complaint-metrics* This is a Spring Boot service running on port 8081. It consumes ComplaintCreated events and calculates a simple metric on how many complaints exist for every given company and makes the metric accessible using a simple REST API:

   GET  :8081    // returns the metric
